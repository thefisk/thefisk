#### Hi <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">
I'm Nathan, and I'm lucky enough to get to play around with computers all day long. I'm very fortunate to get paid to do what I love.

#### Code

- 🪟 I work as an Azure SRE where I play around with Terraform, Azure DevOps pipelines, and Azure CLI
- 🐍 Outside of work I particularly enjoy coding in Python, specifically with the awesome [Django Web Framework](https://github.com/django/django)

#### Hobbies

- 💪 When I'm not playing around with computers, which is rare, I can often be found down my local gym trying to keep fit
- 📷 I also love taking photos! Landscapes, Portraits, Macros...you name it!

I have a new (as of the end of 2021) [blog](https://nathanfisk.co.uk) where I hope to mainly write about Azure, Terraform, and Django.
